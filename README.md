# AT28C256-Programmer-Z80
This project contains code to program AT28C258 EEPROM.

The code implements routines to disable Software Data Protection (SDP), write file to the EEPROM, then enable SDP to avoid the data being written by mistake.

This code implements a command line program for MSX Computers, however the logig to operate the EEPROM is built in and could easily be ported to other paltforms or devices.
